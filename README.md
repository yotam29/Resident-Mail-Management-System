Resident Mail Management System
Introduction
The Resident Mail Management System is a C# project developed in Visual Studio Code using Azure for mail automation and database storage. The system is designed to manage mail records for residents living in a building. It provides functionalities for tracking and updating each resident's mail status and notifying residents when they have mail waiting for pickup. The system also includes authentication for managers to access the system securely.
Features
Mail Record Management: The system allows managers to view and update the mail records for each resident. It keeps track of the status of each mail item, whether it has been delivered or is still waiting for pickup.
Resident Notifications: When a mail item arrives for a resident, the system sends an email notification using Azure's email automation service. The email informs the resident that a package has arrived and is ready for pickup at the staff office.
Database Integration: The system utilizes Azure for database management. The mail records and resident information are stored securely in the Azure cloud, ensuring data integrity and persistence.
Manager Authentication: To access the system, managers must provide a valid username and password. The system only allows access if the credentials are correct, ensuring secure access only for authorized personnel.
